<h1>Book Shelf</h1>

<p>
    Reading has been one of the most impactful ways I've shaped my thinking over the years, and I wanted
    to share some of the titles that have influenced me. I hope you find something valuable in this list as I continue to add to it over time.
    This was inspired by <a href ="https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf" target="_blank">Patrick Collison</a>, whose bookshelf I highly recommend checking out.
